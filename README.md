ABSTRACT


Crime detection and prevention is a standardized method for the identification and study of crime patter
ns and trends. Our program can predict regions that are highly likely to occur in crime, and can imagin
e areas vulnerable to crime. Crime data analysts will help law enforcement officers speed up the crime
resolution process with the growing advent of computerized systems.using the machine learning princi
ple we can derive valuable, previously unknown knowledge from unstructured data. Here we have an a
pproach between computer science and criminal justice to build a method of machine learning which c
an help to solve crimes more quickly. Rather than dwelling on the causes of crime such as criminal rec
ord, political enmity, etc.
The challenge at the outset is’to predict which crime category is most likely to occur, provided a time 
and place.’We picked up various types of features that are seriously affecting the area of high crime, ba
sed on different indicators using different algorithms

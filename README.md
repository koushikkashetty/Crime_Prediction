ABSTRACT


Crime detection and prevention is a standardized method for the identification and study of crime patterns and trends. Our program can predict regions that are highly likely to occur in crime, and can imagine areas vulnerable to crime. Crime data analysts will help law enforcement officers speed up the crime resolution process with the growing advent of computerized systems.using the machine learning principle we can derive valuable, previously unknown knowledge from unstructured data. Here we have an approach between computer science and criminal justice to build a method of machine learning which can help to solve crimes more quickly. Rather than dwelling on the causes of crime such as criminal record, political enmity, etc.
The challenge at the outset is’to predict which crime category is most likely to occur, provided a time and place.’We picked up various types of features that are seriously affecting the area of high crime, based on different indicators using different algorithms.
